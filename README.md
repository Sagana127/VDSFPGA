## Task-1 Status: Completed ✅

### Task Title
**Environment Setup & RISC-V Reference Bring-Up**

### Summary
Task-1 has been successfully completed as per the internship guidelines.  
The objective of establishing a stable development environment and validating the RISC-V reference flow was achieved without using FPGA hardware.

### Key Accomplishments
- GitHub Codespace set up using the official `vsd-riscv2` repository
- RISC-V reference program compiled and executed successfully using:
  - `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc`
  - Spike RISC-V ISA simulator
- VSDFPGA labs cloned and executed that do not require FPGA hardware
- Successful verification through simulation outputs and logs
- Understanding check questions answered with clear architectural reasoning

### Environment Used
- GitHub Codespace only  
- Local setup not required at this stage (Dockerfile reviewed for reference)

### Notes
- No FPGA tools (yosys, nextpnr, programmers) were installed
- FPGA board availability did not impact task completion

📌 Detailed logs, screenshots, and explanations are provided in the **Task-1 README** within this repository.
